Scope: where to look for things.
Javascript has function scope only*

Pass through once through the compiler at first.
Second through the executer.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
Function Declarations vs Function Expressions
What you need to know: if the function keyword is the very first thing in the statement then it's a function declaration.
Otherwise it's a function express.

Named function expressions are better than anonymouse function expression.

Named function expressions are not declared in the outer scope. The name is only enclosed within it's own scope.

Function declarations are declared in the outer scope.

Three Major issues with anonymous function expressions compared to named function expressions.
1) We have no way inside of the function to refer to ourselves. This is an issue with things like recursion. The "This" keyword is not a reference to yourself.
2) Can't identify anonymous in stacktraces for debugging purposes.
3) It doesn't self document the code.  

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
var foo = function bar() {
	var foo = "baz"; 

	function baz(foo) {
		foo = bar;
		foo;    //function....
	}
	baz();

};

foo();
bar();	//Error!

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Block Scope:

The function isn't the only atomic unit of scope. 
99% of javascript developers aren't aware that as of ES3 the catch clause is blocked scope.
Meaning that the variable you declare inside the catch clause can only be accessed inside the catch clause.
IE6 did screw this up, but fixed in IE7.
Linters screw this up for "duplicate variable definitions" and will complain about this "err" variable in catch clauses.
We can just turn off the rule though.
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
var foo;

try {
	foo.length;	
}
catch (err) {
	console.log(err); // TypeError
}

console.log(err); //Reference Error
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
Two predominant models for scoping in javascript

Lexical Scope - most languages deal with. Lexical scope means compile time scope.
The developer decides what the scope will be.  Scope is decided at author-time.

Dynamic Scope - not present in javascript. ie Bash


You can cheat lexical scope using eval keyword. Many people like to pronounce eval as evil.
eval takes any given string and treats the string contents as code.

When you start "cheating" the javascript compiler can not optimize the looksup.  This causes your code to run slower. 
Any time the javascript engine sees the eval keyword in your code, it has to assume the scope of the function as well as the global scope, it can't optimize those look ups.
*As of strict mode, it creates an entirely new scope, when using the eval keyword.
This allows the compiler to still optimize somewhat.

Rule of Thumb
If you have to ask whether or not it's ok to use the eval keyword, then don't use it.
If you need to use it, you already know that.

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//eval keyword example

var bar = "bar";

function foo(str) {
		//modifies the existing lexical scope of foo to add a new declaration to foo at runtime
		eval(str); //cheating!

		console.log(bar); //42
}


foo ("var bar = 42"); 

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
There's an even worse way cheat lexical scope with the "with" keywords.

Why is with keyword is even worse than eval?: 
1) The possibility of creating auto globals. 
2) Where as the eval keyword modifies an existing lexical scope at runtime,
the with keyword creates an entirely NEW Lexical scope at runtime. 

So when the compiler sees the With Keyword it assumes the worst. 

*The with keyword in strict mode is not allowed at all. 

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
var obj = {
	a:2,
	b:3,
	c:4
};

obj.a = obj.b + obj.c;
obj.c = obj.b - obj.a;

with (obj){
	a = b + c;
	d = b - a;
	d = 3; // ??
}

obj.d; //undefined
d; //3 -- oops!
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
 
IIFE Pattern (named by ben alman http://benalman.com/)
Immediately Invoked Function Expression
One of the most popular patterns in javascript.
It does not have to be standalone, it can be part of an assignment.

Used when wanting to hide some code in a separate scope, without polluting the outside scope.
By wrapping the function keyword in parenthises this allows us to create a function expression rather than a function declaration.

//Doug Crockford has a stylistic reason for enclosing the hanging paren (donkey balls)
//it's essentially the same though. 

Essentially we are putting a function value on to the expression stack by wrapping in a parenthises and then immideately executing it. 

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
var foo = "foo";

//IIFE Pattern

(function(){

	var foo = "foo2"; 
	console.log(foo); // "foo2"
})();

console.log(foo); // "foo"

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */

var foo = "foo";

//IIFE Pattern

(function(bar){

	var foo = bar; 
	console.log(foo); // "foo"
})(foo);

console.log(foo); // "foo"
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */


ES6 let Keyword:
It's kind of like var by declaring a variable, but attaching ranther instead to the function scope, but to the block instead.
We are essentially implicitly hijacking our block scoping.

Problems with let keyword:
1) let keyword does not hoist. This can be solved but putting all your lets at the top of your blocks.
2) mental tax for re-factoring because of block scoping. 
3) Implicit scope blocks is usually harder to maintain than explicit scope blocks.

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
function foo() {
	var bar = "bar";
	//if this was a var i the "i" would be attached to the function scope
	//rather than the for loop block scope.
 	for (let i = 0; i < bar.length; i++) {
		console.log(bar.charAt(i));
	}
	console.log(i);
}

foo();
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
function foo(bar) {
	if (bar) {
		let baz = bar; //Implicit scope block with let keyword.
		if (baz) {
			let bam = baz; //Implicit scope block with let keyword.
		}
		console.log(bam); // Error
	}
	console.log(baz); // Error
}
foo("bar"); 

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//This syntax has been rejected by the TC39 Committee
function foo(bar) {
	//Explicit scope block with let keyword.
	let (baz = bar) {  
		console.log(baz); // "bar"
	}
	console.log(baz); // Error
}

foo ("bar");

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Transpiler called let-er
//https://github.com/getify/let-er

let (foo) {
	foo = "foo";
	console.log(foo); // "foo"
}

foo; //ReferenceError

//Transpiles to this code 
try{throw void 0}catch
/*let*/(foo) {
	foo = "foo";
	console.log(foo);
}
foo; // Reference Error
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */


Dynamic Scoping: Scoping based on the callstack. A totally different model for scoping.
Lexical scoping is 99.9% of all languages because it's probably superior in some ways.
The decision for how scoping in dynamic scoping is a runtime decision 
as opposed to lexical scoping which is an authortime decision.

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//theoretical dynamic scoping

function foo() {
	console.log(bar); //dynamic
}

function baz() {
	var bar = "bar";
	foo();
}

baz();

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
QUIZ

1. What type of scoping rule(s) does JavaScript have? Exceptions?
Lexical Scoping. The exceptions to the rule are when using "eval" and "with" keyword.


2. What are the different ways you can create a new scope?
Functions, catch blocks, curly braces with the let keyword.

3. What's the difference between undeclared and undefined?
undefined is a value, where as undeclared hasn't been declared yet.
undefined means currently doesn't have a value so it's a place holder.
Undefined means explicitly that there definitely was a declared variable. Because if you don't then you will get a reference error.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
Hoisting: is a mental construct to explain the behaviors of javascript. 
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Example 1 - before compile phase
a;			// ??
b;          // ??
var a = b;	
var b = 2;
b;			// 2
a;			// ??
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Hoisting happens here during compile time.
//declarations of variables and functions are hoisted to the top because 
//of the compile phase.
//So the above code will execute like this. 
//Example 1 - order of operations after compile phase
var a;  
bar b;
a;		// ???
b;		// ???
a = b; 
b = 2;
b;		// 2
a;		// ???
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Example 2 - before compile phase
var a = b();
bar c = d();
a;				// ???
c;				// ???

function b() {
	return c;
}

var d = function () {
	return b();
}


/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Example 2 - order of operations after compile phase
function b() {
	return c;
}
var a;
var c;
var d;
a = b();
c = d();
a;					// ???
c;					// ???
d = function() {
	return b();
}
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
//Hoisting: functions first
foo(); // "foo"

var foo = 2;

function foo () {
	console.log("bar");
}

funtion foo () {
	console.log("foo");
}
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- */
this Keyword
Every function, while executing, has a reference to its current execution context, called this.

Remember lexical scope vs dynamic scope?

Javascript's version of "dynamic scope" is this.

There are 4 rules for how the this keyword gets bound which depends on the call site.

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
this: implicit & default binding
Default Binding Rule
Fourth rule in order of precedence (Catch All Rule)
*If you're in strict mode default the "this" keyword to the undefined value
*If you're not in strict mode default the "this" keyword to the global object

Third of our four binding rules in order of precedence
*Implicit Binding Rule
*In JavaScript everything is a reference to an object. Everything is a reference to a funtion. 
*You can implicitly put a reference to a funcion on an object
*This allows us to make a reference to a function via the object property reference
*When there is an object property reference at the call site, the implicit binding rule kicks in. 
*The base object becomes the this keyword. 

function foo() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var bar = "bar1";
var o2 = { bar: "bar2", foo: foo };
var o3 = { bar: "bar3", foo: foo };

foo();			// "bar1"  *RULE 4
o2.foo();		// "bar2"  *RULE 3
o3.foo();		// "bar3"  *RULE 3

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */

//This is just another way of showing Rule 3 and Rule 4 in action

var o1 = {
	bar: "bar1",
	foo: function() {
		console.log(this.bar);
	}
};
var o2 = { bar: "bar2", foo: o1.foo };

var bar = "bar3";
var foo = o1.foo;

o1.foo();			// "bar1"  *RULE 3
o2.foo();			// "bar2"  *RULE 3
foo();				// "bar3"  *RULE 4

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
*Detour from rules to talk about binding confusion

this: binding confusion

//problem

function foo() {
	var bar = "bar1";
	baz();
}

function baz() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var bar = "bar2";
foo();				// ??? //bar2 

//posed solution //but this code is actually broken 
function foo() {
	var bar = "bar1";
	this.baz = baz; //*Make a local reference to baz funcion
	this.baz();     //*invoke baz function as my local context
}

function baz() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var bar = "bar2";
foo();				// ??? //bar2 because the default binding rule applies

//this is an impossible problem to solve because you can't mix
//The lexical and the dynamic scope

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
this: explicit binding rule 
Second rule in order of precedence. 
*If you use .call or .apply at the call site take as their first parameter a "this" argument 
*At the call site if there is a call or apply that is explicitly specifying a "this" then use that object for "this"


function foo() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var bar = "bar1";
var obj = { bar: "bar2" };

foo();			// "bar1"  //default binding rule
foo.call(obj);	// "bar2"  //explicit binding rule
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
*Second detour: A frustrating part of "this" binding mechanism is that the functions are very flexible but aren't exactly predictable when it comes to binding.
A way to create predictable binding is to take advantage of hard binding.

this: hard binding

function foo() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar2" };

var orig = foo;
foo = function(){ orig.call(obj); };

foo();			// "bar"
foo.call(obj2); // ???  //this is hard bound to obj and will print "bar"

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
This above code is a little clunky even though it works. Let's create a bind utility to do the same thing.

function bind(fn, o) {
		return function () {
			fn.call(o);
		};
}
function foo() {
	console.log(this.bar);
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar2" };

foo = bind(foo,obj);

foo();			// "bar"
foo.call(obj2);	// ??? 	// "bar"

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
This yet is still a little clunky because we had to create a global utility called bind.
Is there a way we could stick it somewhere less global.
Yes we can put the utility on the function prototype.

if(!Function.prototype.bind2) {
	Function.prototype.bind2 = 
		fucntion(o) {
			var fn = this; // the function!
			return function() {
				return fn.apply(o,arguments);
			};
		};
}

function foo(baz) {
	console.log(this.bar + " " + baz); 
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
foo = foo.bind2(obj);

foo("baz");				//"bar baz"
/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
As of ES5 the bind utility is built into JavaScript
So we don't need our little Bind2 utility, we can just use the built in bind
Which is much more powerful and provides a polyfill which is highly recommended.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind

if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
  Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {
    if (typeof this !== 'function') {
      // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
      // internal IsCallable function
      throw new TypeError('Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable');
    }

    var aArgs   = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1),
        fToBind = this,
        fNOP    = function() {},
        fBound  = function() {
          return fToBind.apply(this instanceof fNOP
                 ? this
                 : oThis,
                 aArgs.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));
        };

    if (this.prototype) {
      // Function.prototype doesn't have a prototype property
      fNOP.prototype = this.prototype; 
    }
    fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

    return fBound;
  };
}

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
this: new
First binding rule in order of precedence
*Using the new keyword in front of any function call and it creates what the spec may call a "constructor call". 
Four things occur when using the "new" keyword in front of a function
1) A BRAND new empty object is created
2) *This object gets linked to a new object
3) The new object gets bound as the this keyword for this function call
4) If this function doesn't otherwise return something then it will implicitly return "this";

function foo() {
	this.baz = "baz";
	console.log(this.bar + " " + baz);
}

var bar = "bar";
var baz = new foo();		// ???
baz.baz;		//baz

/* ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` */
This code will prove the order of prededence, which are these rules:
1. Was the function called with the 'new'?
2. Was the function called with 'call' or 'apply' specifying an explicit this?
3. Was the function called via a containing/owned object (context)?
4. DEFAULT: global object (except strict mode)
 
function something() {
	this.hello = "hello";
	console.log(this.hello,this.who);
}

var who = "global", foobar, bazbam,
	obj1 = { who: "obj1", something: something },
	obj2 = { who: "obj2" };

something(); // "hello"	"global"
console.log(hello); // "hello"		<-- OOPS!!!

obj1.something(); // "hello"	"obj1"
console.log(obj1.hello); // "hello"

obj1.something.call(obj2); // "hello"	"obj2"
console.log(obj2.hello); // "hello"

foobar = something.bind(obj2);
foobar(); 	// "hello" "obj2"
foobar.call(obj1); // "hello" "obj2"

bazbam = new something(); // "hello" "undefined"
console.log(bazbam.hello); // "hello"

bazbam = new obj1.something(); // "hello" "undefined"
bazbam = new foobar(); // "hello"	"undefined"
